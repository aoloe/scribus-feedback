# ideas for improvement

So I have suggestions and ideas, but not as things other people should do, but as things that if people are into, lets organize and in the spirit of open source make it happen.  I'm new to the community, but have moderate experience in computer programing, well versed in many different types of software (been using scribus for years after using InDesign), and I work in design, architecture and do art.  If the developers like any ideas, I'd love to be involved in making it happen.  I've become very big on open source but also dyi. 

I think in terms of accessibility for both new and long time users, it would greatly help if there were an official YouTube scribus tutorial channel that demonstrates the most practical and needed knowledge for new users, but also very specific for specialized users as well.  I learned programs before the age of video tutorials and that was difficult, and now I rely mostly on them, although that still bumpy because most suck or are old and you really have to watch a lot of different ones before you get the sense of whats going on.  time spent putting together good video tutorials is time well spent.   

secondly, as a DYIer I'm also into self publishing, and it would be great if scribus was designed with a focus on that.  I'm talking about both about just hitting print and printing pages at home and doing a self binding one by one, and also being able to just send a document to a printer and they just hit print.  there are different ways to bind books, and that means different ways to order pages.  A very sort of visual and intuitive method of accomplishing both tasks would be awesome...for me at least...but for all who want to self publish.

thirdly, I'm currently riffling through tutorials in attempts of using arduino to make my home a "smart home" and I'm trying to figure out how to use things like jquery mobile, js nodes, javascript, websockts, johnny five, and all this stuff I can't quite get a handle on, but I don't see why it's not possible to create an html-based scribus.  It seems like the coding has gotten to that point, and in terms of open source, alot more people can contribute.  the main functionality would be on the home computer and work off network, but other things like dictionary/thesaurus would be more internet interactive.   It would either be a simple html documents with a lot of js/python files and folds/jgs/css styles and the like..even a basic dictionary that can be downloaded as well.  Seems like the possibilities are a lot more amazing than what is possible with the existing framework.

rant -over.  and again these are ideas I'd totally love to do if others (more knowledgeable than myself) like them and also were interested.
