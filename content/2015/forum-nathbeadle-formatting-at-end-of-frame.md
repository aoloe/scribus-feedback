Normally I can find what I need but this is the first time it seems I'm the only one with this problem (or have problematic eyes and the solution is already posted somewhere).

Over different versions and across different OSes I've noticed a very annoying thing when using Text Frames. I'll create a new text frame, type in some content and then set the font and size and alignment in the Properties window/dialog. Later on I'll come back to edit it by adding some more text at the end of a line/paragraph within the frame. 

If I start typing at the end of the line or if I hit return to start a new line and type the font defaults back to Arial and 12pt and I have to continually change the font settings.

To get around this I'll just start typing one character before the end of a line and that seems to inherit the font properties set and then when done just delete the extra character on the end of my typing.

Anyone else experience this or know what's going on or even better how to stop this from happening? Thank you in advance!
