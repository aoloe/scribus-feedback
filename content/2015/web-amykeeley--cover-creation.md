# Free Software for Indie Authors: Cover Creation

## Scribus

This is only going to be a brief note since I want to talk a little more about this in a later post. For now, let me point out the following about [Scribus](http://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Download "Scribus") and cover creation.

### Pros

*   Built for color management for print.
*   It’s possible to add your own colors to its repertoire.
*   Best pdf export I’ve seen, except for Apache OpenOffice/LibreOffice.

### Cons

*   If you’re using gradients/blends, it’s better to use a program like Inkscape or GIMP and then import what you’ve created into Scribus.
*   It can’t flatten transparency.
*   Very, very, very, very, very non-intuitive. In fact, of all the programs I’ve used so far, Scribus is the least user-friendly of them all. More on that when I talk about Scribus at length for book interiors.

Finally, an odd sort of program to stick into a discussion of cover creation, until you realize what it can do.
